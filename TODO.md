Hi,

I would love to include your shaders in my open source VJ toolkit for Ableton Live: https://github.com/darosh/px-stream

Currently, it's included in the assets/mini-shaders folder with a link to the original post and marked as "license pending clarification" in assets/LICENSE.md.

The project is dual-licensed MIT/CC-BY. I can work with any open license you prefer (CC0, CC-BY, CC-BY-NC-SA, etc.) - or if you'd prefer, I'll remove it immediately.

The shaders are dynamically loaded and user-editable, so people can learn from and tweak your code while creating visuals for their music.

Would you be okay with this? Let me know your preferred license or if you have any concerns.

Best regards,
Jan
```

Hi! Can I include it in my open source VJ toolkit https://github.com/darosh/px-stream ? It's in assets/mini-shaders with link to post, marked "license pending." Any open license works (CC0/BY/BY-NC) or I'll remove it. Thank you!

## Final Checklist

From [m4l-production-guidelines](https://github.com/Ableton/maxdevtools/blob/main/m4l-production-guidelines/m4l-production-guidelines.md)

Here is a checklist to recap the topics of this guide that can be tested, which you can use for **Quality Assurance** purposes for your device.

**General**

- [x] Error messages: There are no prints in the Max Console on load.
- [ ] Undo History: After adding the device, there is only one new undo.
- [ ] Undo History: Live's undo menu is never ‘flooded’.
- [x] Freezing: The device is frozen if it contains dependencies.
- [ ] Presets: The device comes with a collection of presets.

**Audio and MIDI**

- [x] Clicks: There are no unintended audio clicks, when changing parameter values or otherwise.
- [x] Sample rate consistency: Everything continues to work and sound the same when changing the sample rate in Live's preferences.
- [x] Render consistency: The device sounds identical on playback, on a frozen track, and on rendering an audio file.
- [x] MPE: MIDI devices support MPE (`is_mpe` is set to active).
- [x] Latency: The device plays in sync with the rest of the Live Set.
- [x] MIDI Mapping: The main device parameters can be mapped to a MIDI controller.
- [x] MIDI Tools: Random number generators (e.g. `random` objects) in between `live.miditool.in` and `live.miditool.out` must be reset using a seed value before being triggered. The seed value used should only change as a result of user input. This ensures a deterministic output when `live.miditool.in` is repeatedly triggered by Live.

**UI**

- [x] Live themes: All UI objects have theme-following colors, checked with all color themes.
- [ ] Disabling: The UI colors are correct when the device is disabled.
- [x] Positioning: The left-most element in presentation mode is as far from the left side of the device as the right-most element is from the right side.
- [x] Default initialization: Colors and texts that are changed dynamically are saved in their default state to prevent a color or content flash after loading a new instance of the device.
- [x] Font consistency: All UI fonts are set to Live's font.
- [x] Tab stops: Comments don't include any tab stops. The result will look different per OS.
- [x] Device width: The device does not take up too much of the horizontal space in the Device view.
- [x] Device width: If the device can dynamically change its size, make sure the device's custom width setting matches its initial width.

**Parameters**

Note: many of these things can be checked and changed in the View > Parameters window.

- [x] Info fields: All Info Title
- [ ] and Info fields are filled in.
- [ ] Naming: All parameters have non-generic Long Name and Short Name fields. No names have auto-appended indexes, like `[1]`.
- [ ] Automation: The parameter dropdown for a device contains all intended automatable parameters.
- [ ] Value editing: Parameter Types and Units correspond to the kind of data being represented, taking into account that using the Int type gives users a tall grid automation lane.
- [ ] Enum labels: Unit / labels of automation for Enum parameters don't have generic values ("val1"/"val2" for buttons).
- [ ] Modulation: All parameters have a modulation mode set. Bipolar for Float, Absolute for Int, or different if you prefer.
- [ ] Defaults: All default parameter values are correct, i.e. the device works well after newly instantiating it.
- [ ] Save and recall: All parameters are recalled correctly when opening a Live Set that contains the device with non-default values for all parameters.
- [ ] Push: The parameters show up correctly on Push.

**Robustness**

- [ ] CPU Load: The device does not cause unexpectedly high CPU load in the context of a Live Set.
- [ ] Version support: The device runs well with all Live and Max versions starting from the lowest versions set in the device.
- [ ] Platform support: Ideally macOS, Windows and Push 3 Standalone all host the device well.
- [ ] Independence: Multiple instances of the device run well simultaneously.
- [ ] Testing: The device is tested by one or more people besides the device developer.

**For new versions of existing devices**

- [ ] Name consistency: The parameter names are the same as the old version.
    - Take special care of auto-indexed names when there are parameters in abstractions (also in bpatchers) that are instantiated multiple times.
- [ ] Value recall: Parameter values stored in a Live Set with an old version of the device are all recalled properly.
- [ ] API ID recall: Persistent ids stored in a Live Set with an old version of the device are all recalled properly.
